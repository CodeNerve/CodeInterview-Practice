# Important Interview Questions

We've been to quite some interviews and have learnt some tricks that might be handy for people who are going for a coding interview. Preparation of coding interview is vastly different from what you might guess. It is NOT the test of how fast you code, how big you code and how nice your code looks. In fact code interviews are specially testing your ability to think and solve problems along with basic coding skills.

What? So coding interviews do not test your code?

Well, they do look at your code but most of the time what they're looking for is your problem solving skills and thinking ability, which kind of comes if you've alert mind and have a good hand with code. 

So here we would be adding the questions that we came across tons of times for different interviews, and you should prepare for them.
